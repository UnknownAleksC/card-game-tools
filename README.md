<h2>Blackjack Card Counter</h2>
<p>Short project used to get better at using C# and testing out usage of Nuget. The concept is that you go through a round of blackjack, but instead of being in the dark on what to do next, you'll have a card counter to aid you. Most of the work focus was on the backend so the console interaction is a little iffy.</p>
